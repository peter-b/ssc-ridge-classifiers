Introduction
============

This package provides some algorithms for classification of
curvilinear features extracted from SAR images of urban areas, as part
of research into detection of earthquake damage in urban areas.  It
was developed at Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey in
Guildford, UK.

Programs
========

Two programs are provided:

 - The 'ridge-classbayes' tool uses a naive Bayesian classifier with
   two feature variables: return strength and a saliency measure based
   on ridge strength.

 - The 'ridge-classarea' tool classifies features using prior
   probability distributions derived from an idealized urban building
   model.

Installation
============

The 'ssc-ridge-classifiers' package requires the 'mmap()' system call
to support the 'MAP_SHARED' and 'MAP_ANONYMOUS' flags.  Most recent
versions of Linux provide this.

Dependencies
------------

In order to compile and install the 'ssc-ridge-classifiers' package,
you must have the following tools and libraries installed:

 - A C compiler and standard library (GCC/glibc are recommended).

 - The `pkg-config' tool for managing shared libraries.
   <http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/>

 - The 'ssc-ridge-tools' package.
   <https://github.com/peter-b/ssc-ridge-tools>

 - GTK+ (the Gimp Toolkit), version  2.10.0 or later.
   <http://www.gtk.org/>

 - GSL (the GNU Scientific Library), version 1.13 or later.
   <http://wwww.gnu.org/s/gsl/>

 - LibTIFF.
   <http://www.libtiff.org/>

If you are compiling from the 'ssc-ridge-classifiers' git repository,
you will also require:

  - The `git' version control tool, version 1.6 or newer.
    <http://git-scm.com/>

  - GNU Automake, version 1.11.0 or newer.
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>

  - GNU Autoconf, version 2.60 or newer.
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>

  - GNU Libtool.  <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>

Configuration and compilation
-----------------------------

If you are building from git, clone the repository and set up the
source tree:

  git clone git://github.com/peter-b/ssc-ridge-classifiers.git
  cd ssc-ridge-tools
  ./autogen.sh

Otherwise, extract the source files.

You can then proceed to configure, compile and install the tools in
the usual manner:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

For a full list of the options that can be passed to 'configure',
please see:

  ./configure --help
